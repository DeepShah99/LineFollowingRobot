# LineFollowingRobot
During my 3rd year of Engineering, I collaborated with my professor to create a Line Following Robot to encourage juniors regarding field of electronics and programming. I used PID algorithm using Arduino Uno, Pololu QTR8A Analog eight array IR sensor module and L293D motor driver. 
Here is a link to the demo of the LFR - https://youtu.be/K5ppuKDdZOE
